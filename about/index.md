Hi, people. I am the person who made the <a href="https://prism-bright.netlify.app">prism-theme-bright</a> theme for PrismJS. I love to use <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>, since it's so simple (this blog is powered by Eleventy.) and fun to use. My gihub account is right <a href="github.com/noodlesatgithub">here.</a>
